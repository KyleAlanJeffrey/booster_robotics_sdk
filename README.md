# Booster SDK V1.4.1 - Maintained by Kyle Jeffrey
I maintain my own version of the booster python sdk to add a couple features and improve some scripts.
This is currently a maintained fork of the original Booster SDK V1.4.1.

What I've changed:
- binding.cpp to add a couple extra things under the hood
- b1_loco_client.cpp to add a ChangeMode function

## Instructions
Run 
```bash
./install.sh
```
to install the prerequisites

Run 
```bash
./build.sh
```
to build the python booster sdk and install it.
